<div class="title">
    <article>
        The most important reason for using resposiveness and unitless values in our CSS 
        is for supporting our users that rely on zooming.Our users need to be able to zoom without loss of content or functionality.
        Using relative units is good rule for accessible web design;If the user changes their browser's 
        default ofnt size, this enables your page's to resize accordingly.
        With a clever trick for a responsive font size,you can produce an entire page that adjusts dynamically 
        based on the viewport width of the browser.

       <h2>Selectors</h2>
       selectors are at the heart of CSS,CSS allowed the matching of elements by class,type and Id.

        module to include 147 additional Keyword colors.CCS3 also provides us with number of options: HSI, HSLA and RGBA.
        The most notable change with these new color type is the ability to declare <strong>declare semitransparent colors</strong>
        <h2>THE RGBA</h2>
    RGBA works like the RGB,plus adds a fourth value alpha,which is the opacity level or alpha transparency level.
    The value ranges from 1 to 0,where 1 is fully opaque,0 is fully transparent.The values are inclusive
    <h2>Drop shadows</h2>
